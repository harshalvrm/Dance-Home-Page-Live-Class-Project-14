# Dance Home Page Website Design Template : 14th Website in pure HTML and CSS

---

## Description
This is a landing page designed for a Dance Home Page in pure HTML and CSS. The overall design consists of 3 sections. The entire webpage is divided into multiple segments which are the navigation bar, hero section, and bottom section that includes services and a quote.
<br>

This project involves a heavy positioning and alignment of the images, lines and texts. The initial challenge was to design a hollow shape text in the hero section. To design that, I use `text-shadow` property while maintaining the color and playing with shadows to design the hollow effect while making the internal part transparent.In total, I gave `4-5 hours` to build this entire website. 
<br>
The image property was an important element that I learned in this project. Correct cropping and aligning of images were necessary for this webpage. This particular project has trained me more on `Positionin', 'z-index', 'image properties', 'filter property', 'text shadow', and to create stepper using list item & div (By using relative & absolute).
